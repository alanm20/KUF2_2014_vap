 Version 0.1:
 Support  2014 KUF 2 Asia client hero models (in Hero*.pkg files, they are not encrypted).
  
## Installaion:
   Copy this Noesis .py plugin to <Noesis plugins/python/ directory
## Usage:
   Use QuickBMS and kuf2_2014.bms to unpak Hero*.pkg file to their own directory.
   Most *.vap file contains texture and model. Each hero has a .dat file contains model/texture assignment

 There are 5 Heroes type:

 For Gunsliger(Glen):   copy Hero3\*.dat Hero2\ , Use Noesis and browse Hero2 directory for model preview
 For Spellsword(Isabella) copy Hero6\*.dat Hero5\, Use Noesis and browse Hero5 directory for model preview
 Follow same rule to preview the other 3 heroes. 

 The best model file format for exporting to Blender 3D is Noesis gltf format. It adds named prefix to exported files.
